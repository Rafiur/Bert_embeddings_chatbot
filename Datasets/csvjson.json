  {
    "question": "yeah there's no one I can talk to about it no one to listen and understand anyway",

    "answer": "yeah okay so you don't live far from the Uni um but you say you feel like you live with your friends but you don't feel like you can talk to them"
  },
  {
    "question": "I guess I mean it's easier to hide it then to try to explain it all the time when no one really wants to know",
    "answer": "okay so it sounds do you try and hide the way you're feeling from them"
  },
  {
    "question": "no I don't really talk to my parents about it either",
    "answer": "okay so it sounds like you've been feeling down you've been feeling unmotivated and you feel like you want to be better but actually it sounds like you feel like you can't reach out for help you can't speak to anybody"
  },
  {
    "question": "so thats kind of hard",
    "answer": "okay"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah um I guess it kind of started when I was actually when I was revising for my exams um I guess the stress I put a lot of stress on myself I think I've always wanted to do well for me and I guess my parents so the stress of exams and it was also kind of hard because my parents were going through a little bit a troubled time then so",
    "answer": "okay I'm just going to go back in time a little bit suppose I'm just wondering when when did all of this start you said it's been going on for quite a few months"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah I think so",
    "answer": "okay so this would be like last March last April"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah",
    "answer": "around that time so about six months ish and it sounds like a lot was happening so you had a lot of uni pressure on and um you said that your parents were having marital problems"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah I guess it was hard as well because I wasn't doing well at uni and I guess I just felt a bit guilty I I know it sounds silly but I felt like maybe if I could do better than they would get better but I didn't it just wasn't really happening",
    "answer": "okay and it sounds like that was a real shock to you"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah I wanted to make them feel better but it just kind of backfired a little I guess",
    "answer": "okay so it sounds like you were trying to work hard and be more successful because you thought that that would make them happier and try and fix things"
  },
  {
    "question": "well it just ended up with them getting worse and I've just been feeling worse since then",
    "answer": "how did it backfire?"
  },
  {
    "question": "in the end not very well",
    "answer": "okay so after the summer and after the exam period and how did that exam period go for you"
  },
  {
    "question": "it's just annoying because I know I should have done better and I just didn't and I guess I beat myself up a little",
    "answer": "okay there's an awful lot of pressure to put on yourself"
  },
  {
    "question": "properly it may be more than other people my parents have always kind of taught me not in a loving way I guess but that you should do your best but also get the best and I agree with that I think that's the right thing to think but when I don't do that I don't know it annoys me a lot and I worried that it annoys them",
    "answer": "hmm so you say I know I know I should have done better I mean I suppose up hearing it from my perspective I'm thinking it sounds like you had an awful lot going on at the time it'd be understandable absolutely that you wouldn't do as well as normal I suppose I'm just wondering if you have very high standards for yourself"
  },
  {
    "question": "um I think it doesn't sound good I don't really talk to them a lot but I don't think they're going through very good I don't like to talk to them about it because it just makes me feel worse but I don't think it's getting any better",
    "answer": "so it sounds like you feel you should always do your best and that there isn't any kind of exceptions to that and so I can I can see then that was a really difficult time for you and that was when your moods started to get lower and things are still quite bad now I mean what's the situation with your parents at the moment?"
  },
  {
    "question": "for a little bit yeah",
    "answer": "you home over the summer?"
  },
  {
    "question": "not very fun no it was quite tense all the time stressed me out more than relaxed me over the summer",
    "answer": "and how is that"
  },
  {
    "question": "Um really not good to be honest I actually if I don't have to though I don't really leave the house or get out of bed I just I can't find the motivation for the things I used to join them I used to love doing sports or going out and now I just prefer to lie in bed and not really do anything okay I missed a few lectures this week that I should have gone to",
    "answer": "mm-hmm okay okay so it sounds like quite a lot has been happening you've been feeling very low you've had a uni pressure on and you've had problems with your parents marriage and sounds like you feel that you can't really reach out to anyone that you can't understand but you can't really reach out to your parents right now you can't really confide in your friends and so I suppose I'm just wondering if you can tell me a bit more about how you've been feeling I mean say this past week"
  },
  {
    "question": "I don't really see the point anymore if if I can't do as well as I should be doing then what's the point in putting myself in those positions I just I can't be bothered anymore to try it just stresses me out more than it needs to do",
    "answer": "right so I suppose I'm just wondering then it's as if we can think about one thing say a lecture what kind of thoughts do you have about going to our lecture before it happens"
  },
  {
    "question": "so like I dunno I I don't really even deserve to be here if I can't do well enough I see all these other students so doing well and doing better and want to be there I don't know why I'm here even that you need to be",
    "answer": "okay so it sounds like the kind of thoughts you've got in your head are it's pointless and it's not worth it yeah do you have any other thoughts in your head when you're just at that point before you go to the lecture"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah",
    "answer": "so it sounds like you feel like you're not as good as other people there"
  },
  {
    "question": "very unworthy probably would be the best way to put it kind of I don't know lower than normal because then it makes me think about all the things I should have been doing better",
    "answer": "okay um I'm just sorry okay if I take notes as we go through it's just I'm trying to em I guess to em understand what you're telling me and it helps me just to write it down and I'll share this with you later okay so it sounds like those are those are some quite negative thoughts to have you're kind of saying you know it feels like it's pointless it's more effort than it's worth and I don't deserve to be here I mean when you have those thoughts how do you feel?"
  },
  {
    "question": "sad you know, not happiness very sad a bit of kind of anger and frustration as well",
    "answer": "okay so what you described there then what you said that I'm unworthy I should be doing lots of things better and those are kind of what I would call thoughts actually I suppose I'm trying to understand what it feels like in your gut what kind of emotions do you feel happier do you feel sad do you what kind of emotions you feeling when you have those thoughts"
  },
  {
    "question": "yes embarrassed but is it I've never yet to talk about it. It's quite uncomfortable to be in this situation",
    "answer": "I noticed when you're kind of telling me this and I know this is quite a heavy topic but you're kind of laughing and I suppose I wonder a little bit you a bit you know how do you feel about having these emotions talking about these emotions"
  },
  {
    "question": "I used to be I think from those emotions very wound up very kind of stressed all the time but recently it's just a lot more draining than anything just quite lethargic and I just can't be bothered anymore in it my body reflects that but then when I try and sleep I just can't seem to have a satisfied night's slee it's really really frustrating",
    "answer": "okay well you're doing a great job I know I know that this can be difficult okay so it sounds like some of the thoughts you're describing our it's pointless it's more than it's worth I don't deserve to be here I'm unworthy and those kind of thoughts it sounds like they just flip through your mind and and then you're kind of describing different emotions that those lead to kind of scramming sad anger frustration embarrassed what about in your body what happens how do you feel kind of physically"
  },
  {
    "question": "I kind of focus on the negative thoughts when I probably should not think about them but it I focus on them and then I don't really want to do anything and I stay in bed",
    "answer": "so it sounds like this is affecting as it's draining you if your energy like like your body can't be bothered I thin that's a really good way of describing it and you're noticing sleep problems as well and then what do you do so this is so we're back to the point before the lecture so you start having these thoughts these emotions and you know your body I guess it sounds like those thoughts quite draining so we draining your energy what then happens what you do next"
  },
  {
    "question": "no",
    "answer": "so you think even more about this kind of warries so you have to do a bit of dwelling and you stay in bed and it sounds like you don't you know you haven't tried speaking to your friends about it or with your family"
  },
  {
    "question": "I guess I feel up slightly worse but then a bit numb in a way kind of once you've felt that because I do feel tired all the time I just try and push it out and then you don't really think about anything and it's almost nicer that way than to keep focusing on how much you're getting wrong and how much you can't do stuff sometimes it's better just to not think about it at all",
    "answer": "okay and then after you've done that so after you've not gone to the lecture you've stayed in bed you kind of spent time as you said focusing on those those thoughts those negative thoughts how do you feel after that to feel better or do you feel worse"
  },
  {
    "question": "probably in the long run yeah",
    "answer": "so it sounds like in some ways it's a bit of a relief to do that but in other ways maybe think it might make things worse"
  },
  {
    "question": "hi",
    "answer": "hi Hannah nice to meet you"
  },
  {
    "question": "hmm yeah um yeah I guess it kind of started like five six years ago um it kind of escalated a bit and I've just recently moved out um from living with my parents so it made it a bit worse I think",
    "answer": "so I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you've been experiencing some anxiety difficulties"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah I am yes first time much the yeah um I was going to a few years ago just thought it would be easier to stay home",
    "answer": "okay is this the first time that you've left home"
  },
  {
    "question": "um you know its kind of I haven't really told anyone so I mean it's made up like better and since I feel hopefully this is this is it like oh cool it'll help but I don't know I don't like thinking that I've like had to do this I never thought I'd like be the kind of person you'd have to actually go and like get help that makes sense",
    "answer": "okay so it's been quite a big step in a big change and and it sounds like that that was what led you to go to your GP so how has that change things for you"
  },
  {
    "question": "feeling a bit scared I don't know hopefully it will help",
    "answer": "okay so how do you feel about being here today"
  },
  {
    "question": "um I thought that they'd be better but because I thought I'd have to kind of be independent and space actually a lot were so I'm just kind of staying in the house a lot I don't really have any friends or anything I mean my family come and visit a bit but it's not I don't know it's kind of scary because I've just been kind of let you just in the flat by myself which I always thought I'd like but I don't actually like it",
    "answer": "okay so we'd be a little bit anxious about today. Okay so I guess just going back to and why you went to the GP and how you've ended up kind of coming here today so it sounds like you've been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years but just recently moved out of home for the first time and um and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP so how did that change things how were things after you moved out"
  },
  {
    "question": "I mean I'm a photographer and so I kind of it's been stopping me a bit my anxiety from being able to get work and because every time you know there's an opportunity that is kind of involving me having to interact with people I just tend to just turn it down so I was kind of making things hard in that respect and just kind of friends wise and everything I'd feel like I'm just kind of increasingly more alone so it's kind of stopping me from making friends and you know like relationships and stuff",
    "answer": "okay so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah and it was kind of easier when I was at home because I was obviously I mean my parents as have just fine but you know they would I'd go to places with them or I'd kind of have people there but more and more I'm just finding myself just staying again a lot I mean I went like two weeks give coffee with my friends and the whole time I was just kind of wanting to go home again so I don't I just don't want to I don't want that to happen I don't want to lose everyone",
    "answer": "Okay so you said that your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things so they're they're stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they're also stopping you or you feel like it is stunting you socially you're not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah",
    "answer": "so I see kind of worried about how or where this is going to lead to"
  },
  {
    "question": "I guess I'd finished school about a year before that and I mean I've always been a bit shy at school but it was never ever like it didn't really affect that things as much as not at all as much as it has been doing the last few years I guess it just started when it like my friends went to university and I don't know I felt like I was expected to kind of move out or do something and then it just kind of escalated from there I just stopped going to parties or just say no two invitations or and I thought my job would help because I mean I love it I really like doing photography but I'm just kind of getting less and less work as it goes on so which is my fire keep saying no but",
    "answer": "okay so you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago so you would have been about 19 yeah and what was happening around that time"
  },
  {
    "question": "I guess when it I have to kind of be working with other people and I don't like that it's like when I'm trying to kind of would do an event or something where there's a lot of people they're not just photographers but actual you know if I like taking photos of people that I don't know I just kind of find myself saying no I mean I want to do them but just scary so I just don't do it",
    "answer": "what kind of work is the most difficult for you in your job"
  },
  {
    "question": "um just I mean I get really hot and sweaty and I don't I feel like everyone's kind of looking at me and thinking that I'm just like really stupid and feel like they're all going to be staring and thinking I just can't do my job and I'm just an idiot and I mean they'll think that I just look like a weirdo and I just try and I mean I just kind of just try and get out of the situation or just focus on something else so that's why I like doing shots where it's just me and the camera because then I can just put all my attention on that instead of having to you know be with other people",
    "answer": "so just tell me a bit more about what happens then so let's focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with you know it's going to involve photography with with a group of people and you're going to have to have social interaction what kind of thoughts go through your head"
  },
  {
    "question": "just makes me feel like an idiot makes me feel like I just shouldn't even bother trying to do it anyway I should just go home and I just I think I just don't want to be in that situation I just feel like everyone else is fine and they're normal and I'm just the freak you can't like do normal things",
    "answer": "okay so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at another point where you get that invitation you think people look people stare people will think I'm a weirdo there's quite a lot about what what you think other people will think and how does that make you feel"
  },
  {
    "question": "like a work situation?",
    "answer": "okay can you give me an example of a recent situation maybe we can focus on"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah and I was doing a job where it was kind of like a nature shoot and I was having to work with a lot of different people and and and when they told me about the job I thought it would be fine I thought it was just going to be a few other photographers but there are actually people and you know I've taken photos of people kind of in the trees and stuff like that",
    "answer": "yeah time when you may be doing a job with some people and you've got the social anxiety you know that you're describing about that kick in"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah it was a fashion thing I think it was for some kind of I'm not sure if it was a campaign or something but yeah it was really cool but I found it really hard to try and focus I was so I was kind of feeling really anxious",
    "answer": "that sounds quite interesting was that a fashion shoot?"
  },
  {
    "question": "no",
    "answer": "so it wasn't what you expected"
  },
  {
    "question": "that was two weeks ago",
    "answer": "so how long ago was that"
  },
  {
    "question": "just felt really just really kind of like I couldn't really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just focus and just you know like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything but I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they'd say action and they'd try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid and I shouldn't have been there",
    "answer": "okay so it's quite recent so on that particular day what were the thoughts that you had in your head when you were in that situation"
  },
  {
    "question": "I was just like trying to focused on it I was just thinking if I could just hold it really tightly it would just I don't know I'd kind of just be able to just get through it and just focus",
    "answer": "I can tell you getting kind of anxious even just thinking about that day. So you describing quite a lot there to me so you're saying that you kind of got hot and sweaty you also  said that you held the camera what was do you mean you kind of trying to hide behind it"
  },
  {
    "question": "because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just though at least if I can just I don't know it sounds weird but I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands are kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads like and I could just tell everyone was looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it it wouldn't be as noticeable but",
    "answer": "so you're holding the camera very tight and why was that why was that helpful"
  },
  {
    "question": "just I was just just stupid and was just really just felt really like a kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just they could tell and just thinking or what's she doing and that I was just really like sweaty and just",
    "answer": "okay so it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head and you said that you worried that everyone's looking at you what other thoughts were there that were in your mind"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah and I was trying to wear black so this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers so they can't tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just was just wishing that I just wasn't there",
    "answer": "so like that they could see you shaking"
  },
  {
    "question": "I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew vow'd was probably sweating and shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and it was like definitely really noticeable everyone could definitely stay",
    "answer": "so I mean you've already described it to me a little bit but if you think about how you look that day how do you say how do you think you looked"
  },
  {
    "question": "well again I was trying to grip the camera just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean that they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and look down not try it like not look at anyone else and just yeah just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could",
    "answer": "ok and what did you do about it? how did you try and conceal that or hide that"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah no I always do that even if it's really hot or I wear just loads of layers and just because was I'll just be really sweaty and like people would definitely be able to see so",
    "answer": "so you avoid looking at people and sounds like you wore black as well in kind of preparation"
  },
  {
    "question": "well it kind of went on for like an hour or so and then people were going and just after every shoot people go out for drinks after just to kind of celebrate like that we've done it I just I went home straight away just got in my car and went home I just didn't want to be around them especially after they would have seen me being weird and I just wanted to go get home straight away",
    "answer": "okay and how did it end"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah that's something that's always on my mind",
    "answer": "okay so you said that when you're at work you really worry that you're going to say something stupid"
  },
  {
    "question": "because people would think I was weird",
    "answer": "what would be so bad about that if you did say something stupid at work"
  },
  {
    "question": "they wouldn't want to be friends of me",
    "answer": "then what would be so bad if people at work thought you are weird"
  },
  {
    "question": "well I just have no one to talk to at work",
    "answer": "and what would be so bad about that if people that worked and want to be friends with you"
  },
  {
    "question": "that's I mean the shoots can go on the whole day so just be by myself the whole time",
    "answer": "then what would be so bad about having our to talk to at work"
  },
  {
    "question": "I don't know I guess I should be used to it now I spend a lot of my time by myself",
    "answer": "and what would be so bad about being by yourself you know for a whole day"
  },
  {
    "question": "you know I guess it's just like I spend so much time by myself that's kind of like I'm not even worth being friends with",
    "answer": "that must be tough what does that mean to you that you spend a lot of time on your own"
  },
  {
    "question": "guess like ninety out of a hundred",
    "answer": "so it sounds like deep down that you think that you're not worth being friends with and that's quite quite a negative belief I mean how much would you say that you believe that out of a hundred if a hundred is where you believe it totally in zeros where you don't believe it at all"
  },
  {
    "question": "uhm I think it was probably at school yeah and I guess school",
    "answer": "when did you start believing that"
  },
  {
    "question": "just like quite a lot of things like a wouldn't have anyone to sit with at lunch or people's birthdays and stuff I wasn't invited and you know like I was the last one picked for teams and stuff like that",
    "answer": "and what was it about school that that made you start to believe that you weren't worth being friends with"
  },
  {
    "question": "I mean it's kind of similar at work obviously differences that it's it's work not school and you know people go for drinks and stuff after work or after a shoot and I just kind of excluded a lot of time",
    "answer": "and what is it now that makes you think that that's still true"
  },
  {
    "question": "I guess my friends and family would say I am like I try to make a lot of time for my friends and stuff",
    "answer": "mm-hmm that sounds tough and is there anything that makes you think that it's not true that that you are worth being friends with"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay",
    "answer": "okay so it sounds like deep down you have this thought that you're not worth being friends with and that started at school when you had trouble making friends at school and that you can't always pick for teams and that now at work it feels like the same thing is happening and that you're not always invited out for drinks with people after work and that sometimes you feel that you're excluded from their social groups but then that's not the whole story that on the other hand you are close to family and you do have friends who would say that it's not true that you are with being friends with and in CBT we do a thing called thought challenging where when we have these negative thoughts sometimes we we actually put them up to two scrutiny we weigh up the evidence for and against them and I like to think of it as putting the thought on trial could we do that now where we just actually try and weigh up the evidence for and against that thought a bit more"
  },
  {
    "question": "oh just like I kind of don't go to a lot of stuff and people have like gatherings and things and a lot the time I just I don't go and I'll just stay at home don't go to parties",
    "answer": "so if I just put two columns here so for and against and it sounds like the evidence for this thought that makes you think that it is true is there difficulty at school yeah making friends being picked for teams and difficulty at work feeling excluded sometimes from groups yeah but actually in this other column we have that you are close with your family and that you have some close friends okay now moving back to this first column is there anything else that makes you think it's true that that you're not worth being friends with"
  },
  {
    "question": "mainly big ones and if there's a lot of people there I just find it really it kind of makes me really anxious so a lot of the time I just prefer not even to be in that situation in the first place",
    "answer": "what kind of parties are we talking like big parties small parties"
  },
  {
    "question": "I mean I guess my friends would say that I was and I do I do have close friends and you know and it's like their stuff that's important to them I always make sure that I think about that and even if I find it stressful I'll always make sure that I can kind of put them first",
    "answer": "okay so you don't go to larger parties and events okay is there anything else that maybe thinks that it makes you think that it's not true that actually you are worth being friends with"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah I do make sure I try I try and do that",
    "answer": "okay so your friends would say that you are worth being friends with and it sounds like you put your friends first"
  },
  {
    "question": "um I guess when it's birthdays or in it something important to them um I'll always make sure that I'm there and that I put a lot of thought into presents and stuff like that",
    "answer": "what kind of ways do you put your friends first"
  },
  {
    "question": "and it was my friend's birthday a few weeks ago and we did like a big surprise at hers and I made a cake and stuff like that so",
    "answer": "can you give me an example of a time that you've done that"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah",
    "answer": "so you actually helped to organize events for your friends"
  },
  {
    "question": "um I guess so I kind of always put myself in situations even if I find it kind of it makes me anxious if it's for my close friends and I know that is something that's important to them then I'll always put them first and make sure I'm there",
    "answer": "is there anything that you do that you wouldn't do if you weren't a good friend"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah",
    "answer": "so you'll tolerate your anxiety if it means something to a friend of yours"
  },
  {
    "question": "I mean I still have my friends so I guess if I wasn't worth being friends with though I wouldn't have these friends I've had quite quite a long time",
    "answer": "okay so at the moment in the four category we've got that you had difficulty making friends at school that you're having difficulty now at work making friends and then you don't go to larger parties or events but actually there's a lot of evidence in the against column evidence that would suggest that actually you are worth being friends with and you're a good friend that you're close with your family you're close with your friends your friends would say that you're a good friend you put your friends first and even when you're anxious you tolerate that anxiety if you know it'll mean something to them that when things are important to your friends like birthdays and you'll make a real effort you'll even actually go to the effort of organizing events and baking cakes and doing things like that for other people and is there anything else that you do that makes you think that maybe you are a good friend you are worth being friends with"
  },
  {
    "question": "um it's weird there's actually kind of more stuff in the against and there is in the for I guess also love the stuff that is in the four columns kind of things that I make happen like I don't go to things yeah it seems like some of its kind of in my in my hands",
    "answer": "okay so it sounds like you've got long-term friendships as well so you might have trouble making friends but when you make them you stick with them I am just going to give you this list now to have a look at how do you feel now that you're looking at that list"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah I think so yeah",
    "answer": "so it's not that you're not worth being friends with but actually that you're choosing not to engage with people always"
  },
  {
    "question": "um I guess I'd say maybe 40 I think I do still think that it might be true but I think I believe it less than I did before",
    "answer": "okay and if I was asking now you know this idea that you're not worth being friends with how much do you believe that now that we've done this exercise where 100 is where you really believe that you're not worth being friends with in zeros that you don't believe it"
  },
  {
    "question": "I'm all right.",
    "answer": "Hi, Elizabeth, how are you doing today?"
  },
  {
    "question": "It's about the same. I'm still feeling pretty down. I just feel really stuck and not happy, and I just don't know why.",
    "answer": "How have things been going since the last time we met?"
  },
  {
    "question": "I mean I've been feeling really isolated lately. Because I'm a stay-at-home mom it's hard, there's not a lot of people right at my fingertips to spend my time with, obviously my family but. So I guess I had some friends in the neighborhood but our friendships just kind of fizzled out and ever since then it's just like I don't really feel like doing much. I just kind of feel like what's the point and let my husband take care of a lot of stuff. I used to shop at the groceries all the time and make sure the house is always stocked and make dinner every night and get the kids ready for school in the morning, and I still do that stuff but a lot of times I let it slide. Sometimes I won't make dinner or whatever, and when I do do it I just feel like I'm forcing myself to do it. The passion is gone.",
    "answer": "Okay, so there's a few things going on there. You said you're feeling stuck. Not happy and you sound like you're a little confused as to what's going on, what's causing it. You have any suspicions about what might be causing it?"
  },
  {
    "question": "For a long time. I have two boys, they're eight and ten, and I've been staying home since my first one was born, so ten years. It's been really rewarding for me. I'm not really interested in going back to work or anything like that cause I know people always say you're feeling unfulfilled, like you should go back to work, but it's not. I felt happy with it for so long. I don't think that it's being home. I think it's something inside of me.",
    "answer": "And how long have you been, you say housewife, right? How long have you been a housewife?"
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah.",
    "answer": "Something has changed, yeah? So for a long time you were satisfied being a housewife. You enjoyed that life or found satisfaction in that life and somewhere along the line something changed in you. And now you're not happy with it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah, exactly. Well, I guess, my youngest is eight so he's only been in school for a couple of years so I guess it's not super recent but recently I finally have no children in the home so it's more time to myself. And I kind of filled that gap a little bit with other things like I did Cub Scouts with the boys for a while and, like I said, I had some friends around the neighborhood so that kind of filled that time, but now that stuff it's just not really happening anymore so now I kind of feel like. It's not boredom. It's not like I don't have enough to do. It's like I don't want to do anything, but then at the same time I feel frustrated because there's nothing to do.",
    "answer": "So what it represents in terms of activities like caring for your children and shopping, none of that's really changed."
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah, I think a lot more with myself because I know that I would feel better if I maybe found more friends or found something to do with my time, but I don't want to at the same time. So I'm frustrated with myself because I kind of know what would help but then I don't really have the volition to do it.",
    "answer": "All right, so you're frustrated with your situation, maybe with yourself a little bit."
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah, I'm not motivated.",
    "answer": "You're not motivated."
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah, obviously my husband has noticed because he has to get the boys ready in the morning. He's really supportive. I know he can tell that I'm not feeling the same, but he works and then he has to come home and pick up my slack so he's getting frustrated, which I understand. My mom has said to me that she thinks I'm not doing as much, and so it kind of hurts. It feels like everybody's trying to tell me I'm lazy and that I'm not doing enough, and it's always that feeling like nobody really understands how much work goes into being a mother. But then at the same time now that I'm doing less and less I feel like they're all right, I am lazy, I'm not doing anything.",
    "answer": "Have you received any feedback from other people about this? Meaning has anyone else noticed that you're down?"
  },
  {
    "question": "No, not that I can remember. I think my mom said you're not doing as much as you used to, and I kind of took offense to that. Even though it's kind of true, it's like, I don't know, it hurt.",
    "answer": "They use the word lazy?"
  },
  {
    "question": "I think at first we didn't really acknowledge it. It was like I took a break here, he picked up the slack and it was fine. But now that it's been more and more, he's kind of getting frustrated and he's been asking me about how I feel and why I'm not doing as much. But at the same time even though he knows that I'm not motivated it's still frustrating because it's my responsibilities. So I think he's been saying I need you to do more around the house, pretty much is what he said. I need you to do more.",
    "answer": "Okay, that was painful for you. What about what your husband said? What's he been saying?"
  },
  {
    "question": "I started crying because I know he's right and that's what I tell myself every day, I need to do more. But I don't have the motivation to do it and so I'm so frustrated with myself. I know that he needs that from me and I don't know why I'm not motivated to do it.",
    "answer": "What was your response to that when he said I need you to do more?"
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah.",
    "answer": "Okay, so you're frustrated for feeling down."
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah, I actually think I've been feeling this way more in the past six months or something like that. It was hard for me when my youngest son went to school but more in the natural way that it is hard. But this is something else. This is more consuming. The difficulty of him going away to school almost was motivating. It was hard but at the same time it was freeing because I had other opportunities to do stuff. This is just like stunting.",
    "answer": "And you're frustrated for lacking motivation. And just as little as a few years ago you didn't feel it this way at all."
  },
  {
    "question": "Sure. On Wednesday I was having a really hard time getting out of bed so my husband just got the kids ready in the morning, and I felt really bad about that so I just stayed in bed for a couple more hours, probably until like Then I got up and made myself something to eat and then I thought I should probably go to the store because we're almost out of milk and I think the boys need shampoo, but I just sat down and I just sat there, and I think I sat for, I don't even know how long. The boys came home from school, it was like, and I hadn't even gotten up. So then I said, okay, the boys are home I should probably get started on dinner soon because my husband will be home soon. I found something in the fridge to make, and I made dinner. After that everybody just sat down, we just watched TV and I just sat there until it was time to go to bed.",
    "answer": "Okay, so let me shift gears a little bit. Can you tell me about your, well, a recent day that's kind of typical of what you're telling me now? Meaning not motivated, down."
  },
  {
    "question": "I wish that I would wake up and I would want to wake up when it was time for the kids to get ready to go to school. I could make sure that they had everything they needed. I could pack their lunches and get the boys dressed and check if they needed any permission slips signed, that kind of thing. Send them out the door and then I would see if we needed anything from the store. I'd probably do a little bit of cleaning around the house. I used to have a list of chores that I would do different things on different days and different days of the month and stuff. So like bedding would get washed one day of the week and that kind of thing. So I would probably follow that list. Nowadays I just, if it gets done, it gets done, and usually my husband helps me with some of the stuff. I would do the bathrooms one day a week. That probably gets done like once a month now. But I would do that. So do the cleaning. If I needed to go to the store I would do that. I'd get ready for the boys to come home. I'd probably make them a snack and figure out what was gonna be for dinner. I would go ahead and do that and then probably. Sometimes we would watch TV after my husband got home after dinner or I would figure out something for us to do. We could play a board game or all watch a movie as a family or something like that. But that would be after the kids did their homework and everything like that. And then after we spend some time together I'd put them to bed.",
    "answer": "All right, and you said this was recently, right? What would the ideal day have looked like? Take that same day and do what you wish you could have done."
  },
  {
    "question": "Mm hmm.",
    "answer": "All right, so there's a fairly wide discrepancy between where you are in terms of behavior, right? And where you want to be."
  },
  {
    "question": "It's just the alarm goes off and I know it's time to get up and my husband's getting out of bed and I just look at the clock and I think what's the point. It's just this instant feeling of, I can't even describe it, like pointlessness of getting up so I go back to sleep, but I feel worse for doing it. It's a catch-22. I don't want to wake up, I just don't want to, but then when I go back to sleep I feel bad, I feel guilty.",
    "answer": "All right, so let me ask you a very specific question about one of the first things in the day. You had mentioned that when it was time to get up, right, you didn't. So you were awake and aware of it but you went back to sleep I presume. And of course your husband got up and he took care of things, right? How did you feel allowing that to happen? Cause clearly that's not what you wanted to happen. How did you feel about that, oversleeping?"
  },
  {
    "question": "It's just like when I'm sleeping I don't realize how sad I am and I don't realize how hard it is to function. When I'm sleeping I'm not aware of that and as soon as I wake up I am. And so I just have this feeling of like what's the point of getting up and experiencing these feelings when I could go back to sleep and not have to.",
    "answer": "Okay, so by not getting up at a time you wanted you feel guilty, but you also mentioned something that you thought. Which was, if I'm not mistaken, you said what's the point. Can you expand on that?"
  },
  {
    "question": "Yes, yeah.",
    "answer": "What's the point of getting up when sleeping will keep the pain at bay?"
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely.",
    "answer": "Okay, okay. But then when you do get up you feel sad and guilty about having overslept."
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah.",
    "answer": "So really functionally what you're doing is you're delaying experiencing the pain."
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah.",
    "answer": "And then in terms of how it affects your relationships in your family, you're not getting your kids off to school, your husband's getting real frustrated. And all you've really bought yourself is a couple extra hours sleep. And presumably without pain cause you're sleeping. But you're not really escaping it. Does that make sense?"
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah, it was so easy. I would wake up and I would be like, okay, it's time to get up and get out of bed and get ready to go. Sometimes if I was a little bit tired it would be a little bit hard but it's not, as a stay-at-home mom I usually get enough sleep for the most part now that the kids are older and everything. So it's not usually too hard to get up, and it would be another good day. I would be glad to get up and take care of the things that I needed to take care of, and I felt accomplished.",
    "answer": "Before when you felt more satisfaction and purpose, did you get up and help the kids off to school?"
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah, yeah. I mean I want everything to be normal again, and I guess I never really thought of it like that. I just thought, well, if I'm waking up at the right time and I'm just feeling bad then, like I said, what's the point. But I guess it makes sense even if I don't feel like doing it maybe it will make me feel better if I do do it even if it's hard because nothing is really harder than what I'm already going through.",
    "answer": "All right, so maybe what's going on here, or maybe what could help, remember over the last few sessions we've talked about cognitive behavioral therapy and the different techniques that I'll be using and different things we're talking about. Sometimes with behavior, the behavior that's useful, which in this case I'm assuming we can agree is the getting up on time. Behavior that's useful has to come first even if the feeling doesn't match, right? So sleeping those extram I presume a couple hours delays you from feeling sad but it causes other problems. If you were to get up on time you might still feel sad, right, because that's why you're oversleeping, that's why you're sleeping longer, to avoid that, but the functional part of being a housewife as you identify would be completed. So maybe some of those feelings of sadness and guilt would over time abate because functionally speaking you're completing the task that you want. What's tough about that is that in the moment it's easy for me to say this now, right, but in the moment, like for instance when you have to get up out of bed tomorrow, you're gonna be facing that same challenge, which is I can get up now and feel depressed or I can wait and feel depressed later. So in that moment it's hard to act on the behavior that you kind of know you want to move towards. I mean it sounds like you want to get up and see the kids off to school."
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah, and also I guess I thought that, no, it wouldn't really be that beneficial to get up.",
    "answer": "Well, it seems like you're more or less making things worse, right, in an effort to avoid the pain that you're gonna suffer anyway. You're making the pain worse and just delaying it a little bit, right? What thought, remember we talked before about automatic thoughts, these thoughts that come up kind of when your belief system meets these different situations that occur. When you have that thought that this is pointless, right, and I'm gonna expand on that thought a little and say that what that thought's really getting at is I can avoid this pain if I sleep a little while longer, right? That's a version of the thought. Does that make sense?"
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah, yeah.",
    "answer": "Okay, so you're also minimizing the benefit. So there's a couple things going on, right? I can avoid the pain by sleeping in and there's really no point to getting up cause it won't do any good anyway."
  },
  {
    "question": "I guess I could tell myself I can do this. Instead of when I say to myself what's the point, instead I can say I can do this, I can get out of bed, it'll be okay. I'm strong enough, even though it's hard, to push through the pain and get up now. Even though I don't want to I can say I can do this.",
    "answer": "What adaptive response, that self-talk we talked about, those things we consciously think to ourselves, could you apply in that moment when your whatever time you get up in the morning when you're thinking about this and that thought comes in that it doesn't really matter if I get up anyway?"
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah, I mean I know it's valuable. I guess what my frustration is is that I know it's valuable and it used to give me an emotional payoff of pride and satisfaction and now I'm not getting that anymore. So I guess I need to realize that even though I'm not getting it right now if I keep trying maybe it will happen again because it did happen before.",
    "answer": "Okay, so that would be your adaptive response. I'm strong enough. I can get through this but it will be difficult. How about the value of getting up early and seeing the kids off to school? The automatic thought right now is telling you that's not valuable, but I think that you believe it is valuable."
  },
  {
    "question": "I guess that's true, yeah. I'll never get the satisfaction of sending my kids off to school if I never send my kids off to school.",
    "answer": "Well, it seemed logical that you have a higher probability of getting that back if you do get up than if you sleep in, right?"
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah, I never thought about it like that.",
    "answer": "Right, so you have a zero percent chance of successfully moving past this with the sleeping in and you have some other probability greater than zero if you do."
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah.",
    "answer": "Does that kind of make sense?"
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah, yeah.",
    "answer": "So even though getting up early is gonna be painful and gonna seem like not a practical move, logically you know that it has a better chance of paying off for you. And I think that with these type of, and what you're going through is probably depression, right? I'd like to talk to you further to make sure that's what's going on but it seems like you're depressed. And sometimes with depression you just have to get one thing going your way each day, right? So I'm not saying necessarily tomorrow you have to get up on time and then go make new friends and then go find social activities, right? You don't have to build Rome in a day here, right? It's more like can I do this one thing. Can I prove to myself just what I'm saying, which is I'm strong enough to get up, see the kids off and have that one victory for tomorrow. Right, and build on that."
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah, and not letting the negative thoughts take over because that's what I'm thinking like. Okay, I can get the kids off to school but after that I'm gonna start thinking what's the point again, why don't I just sit down, there's no point. So if I can keep reminding myself that I just have to try and that I did accomplish something then even though it's hard and I know that those thoughts are gonna come back and that I'm gonna feel bad, if I don't do anything I'm not gonna feel any better.",
    "answer": "And part of that's gonna be playing those adaptive responses back, right, thinking those thoughts. Whether it's just thinking them in your mind or actually thinking them and saying them. Sometimes it's helpful just to say them out loud."
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah.",
    "answer": "So you have a good handle on the adaptive responses it sounds like, right? And you know what you have to, or I don't want to say have to, but you know what you want to do."
  },
  {
    "question": "Mm hmm, yeah.",
    "answer": "I see you again in a week. And there'll be five days in there in between now and when I see you again where you'll have to decide whether you want to get up and see your kids off to school or not, right? So I want you to give that a try, the adaptive responses and try to push through with that behavior. Now it's important to keep in mind that we have five days between now and when I see you again, five business days, school days."
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah.",
    "answer": "You may not succeed every day in this. That's okay. All right. Sometimes the setbacks, you could get up early two days in a row and then you could have a setback that third day. Don't let that wash away those successes."
  },
  {
    "question": "Okay.",
    "answer": "All right. It's a day-by-day fight. Try not to think of it in terms of the week. I want you to try to think of it in terms of what do I have to do today. All right, not worrying about the future and not worrying about what you've done in the past."
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah, I could probably try that.",
    "answer": "All right, the only moment where really can live in is now. So try to stay present in the moment, recite those adaptive responses and try to push for just that one victory. Okay, can you try that?"
  },
  {
    "question": "All right, thank you.",
    "answer": "All right, so work on that and continue with the homework, the CBT homework I've been giving you, and I'll see you next week."
  },
  {
    "question": "hey i'm good how are you",
    "answer": "hey mikayla how are you"
  },
  {
    "question": "it's different",
    "answer": "I'm doing pretty good how is things going at school"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay",
    "answer": "yeah we're gonna get into it in a second i'm gonna set a timer for 45 minutes to make sure that we don't go over time"
  },
  {
    "question": "probably being in the bed for most of my classes and being on campus like usually you can schedule time to meet with your professor i like to go over the syllabus or something and then now if you have to do a whiteboard call and then you'll be on the actual phone with them and then you'll see them writing on the board on your computer and that's different and then being like separated from everyone and wearing the mask 24 7.",
    "answer": "so tell me about it what's what's so different now"
  },
  {
    "question": "my anxiety",
    "answer": "oh and i'm thinking that might be the best of both worlds you get to be in the bed and go to class i thought that was that might be fun okay so um i just kind of wanted to start by doing a recap from some notes that i took from our last session so what we've been working on with you do you know what we've been working on just to kind of make sure we're on the same page"
  },
  {
    "question": "um it's it's been up and down",
    "answer": "yeah so we've been trying to make sure that we can really um get a good handle on when it's showing up how um how it's showing up meaning how intense is it when you notice it and then where are you feeling it in your body and then we really wanted to hone in on what your thinking is when that anxiety comes up like what are those stories that you're telling toyourself so we can start kind of working backwards so we know when it's showing up so then we want to do some root cause work to look at well what what beliefs do you possibly have around um some of these negative thoughts that are coming up and then we can start to deconstruct that a little bit more but we're going to get into that later um but i first just wanted to do an overview of kind of how your your week has been"
  },
  {
    "question": "like for my monday wednesday friday courses i haven't had them because there were like issues with blackboard so students were getting locked out and they couldn't log into their classes and then because we're not in class we don't know any of the people so we're kind of like contacting people from like old club groups to kind of figure out what to do or how to fix issues because you have to have appointments to go meet with like technology people or anybody so it's like it's difficult to do that being in your room it's just been up and down for me",
    "answer": "okay how so"
  },
  {
    "question": "yes i transferred it to my planner",
    "answer": "okay um so when if you noticed um because i know we talked about before is um working on a mood chart and were you able to download the mood chart"
  },
  {
    "question": "i noticed i get anxious the most over things that i can't control",
    "answer": "oh good okay so with the mood chart we were really looking at times when you noticed that your anxiety was the worst um situations that occur when you noticed it so when you started tracking on your mood chart what did you notice"

  {
    "question": "if it's something like yesterday for instance one of my professors emailed me and told me that i was enrolled in the wrong physics class and then i needed to switch to class so then i go to try to switch to class and then i'm unable to do that because we've already started the classes and then i was worried that there was going to be a W on my transcript and then i also i realized it was something that i couldn't fix because it was on a weekend so it's like it's wednesday then i was anxious i was like worried that i couldn't get out of the class or i'll have to stay in this class and it doesn't count towards my degree so my mind just started going through like all the bad yeah i'm thinking okay i can't get out of this class and then it may be too late to drop the class when i'm stuck it won't count towards my degree and i'll just be taking it for nothing my mind went straight to the extreme instead of just saying just wait until monday right i noticed that",
    "answer": "okay that's good that's a good observation"
  },
  {
    "question": "so in the beginning i kind of feel like in my chest it's more like the breathing sometimes it gets faster and then like sometimes it feels like i'm gonna cry but the biggest thing is in my chest",
    "answer": "okay good that's a good observation so one of the things that's important to know when that comes up is not just your thinking process noticing what you're thinking but then also noticing the physical symptoms that come along with that because when you're dealing with anxiety not only is it dealing with how you're thinking but it's also causing physical symptoms in your body so when you notice that anxiety comes up for you where do you normally feel it"
  },
  {
    "question": "sometimes it gets tight or like kind of like if you're claustrophobic and you're like in a room it kind of feels like like i'm hyperventilating sometimes yeah",
    "answer": "okay what do you notice in your chest"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah",
    "answer": "so your breathing gets kind of shallow"
  },
  {
    "question": "um i do the leg thing like tap my legs",
    "answer": "okay do you notice any other physical symptoms in your body"
  },
  {
    "question": "let me see your nails you've been biting your nails",
    "answer": "you tap your hat sometimes or sometimes i'll bite my nails okay biggest thing would just be my my chest"
  },
  {
    "question": "they don't look too bad they are not down to the meat they don't look too bad okay so you notice um tightness in your chest what about sweating do you notice any sweating",
    "answer": "no not recently"
  },
  {
    "question": "no okay so the reason why it's going to be important for you to attune to those physical symptoms is because you can know when the anxiety is coming or when it starts starting to ramp up and then when you notice those physical symptoms those will be the times when you want to catch it before it starts spiraling down into something that you can't control so the more a tune that you get to noticing when your breathing is shallow noticing when you feel that tightness in your chest then you can go to your tools that we're creating for you so then you can use those things as soon as it comes now that's not going to be effective all the time but the goal is more often than not you'll start to be more in control of it to where it doesn't feel like it's controlling your life and you find yourself overwhelmed over things that you can't control and ruminating and thinking to where those thoughts start to spiral down into something more negative so the whole idea is to catch it before um it becomes something like i said something that you can't control or that's unable to be managed so i think that's good that you're recognizing how it's physically impacting you and then you're also being able to pinpoint it to specific situations in your life is it anything else where you notice that that anxiety came up for you outside of um trying to schedule your classes",
    "answer": "no"
  },
  {
    "question": "oh so that exposure",
    "answer": "um i think far as like the virus being around people i think like um when i was at home most of the times i was always in the house or i never went out and listened grocery shopping or something so it's like now if i don't eat in my room if i want to go to the cast it's like there are 4 000 other people that's on campus and there's like a possibility that they were around someone who had it or i know a girl her dad actually died from it and she's back on campus so it's like"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay how are you managing that",
    "answer": "yeah"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah and that's a real legitimate worry because people literally are dying from it every day yeah and the the bad thing about it is it's kind of no rhyme or reason to it you really don't know who can recover from it or who is dying from it so i understand wanting to be extra constant cautious so you don't put yourself at risk but yeah it's hard to tell because you never really know",
    "answer": "um i can't use a lot of hand sanitizer or don't go out if i don't need to"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah and and i understand that because that's one of the main reasons you go to college is to have that college experience and then it kind of feels like it gets robbed from you",
    "answer": "i think another thing is being on campus you're still trying to finish getting your college experience so not being not being able to do the things that you used to do like going out with your friends or going to eat you don't really have that luxury"
  },
  {
    "question": "oh yeah",
    "answer": "and then we had because we have incoming freshmen so we've had a welcome week and it's kind of like welcoming the freshmen them getting to know like our sga um leaders and stuff like that and we did um bama state bingo so you were allowed to go in like our little theater area but you had to sit like two um places from your friends and then it was like two rows so like every other row you weren't allowed to sit in so it's like usually the room is like packed it's like a hundred students but now it's like 15 students could only be in it"
  },
  {
    "question": "so it changes the whole dynamic of it",
    "answer": "it's really different"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah so that sounds like three main things that you brought up so far was um noticing that the the whole college experience has changed some and then noticing that um you kind of have to be worried about whether or not covet can whether or not it's something that you can contract or something that you can be diagnosed with and then um the scenario around you um scheduling your classes so those were the three areas that you noticed that the anxiety came up do you think in all three of those instances it stemmed from the same thing of that something that i can't control like these things are outside of my control",
    "answer": "yeah then it's kind of it's less fun because it's like all the fun people they're always late so then they don't get to come in something this is boring and everybody's staring at each other it's just odd"
  },
  {
    "question": "right right and then for that last one too that the whole college experience now that one might be a little different though that might be something that is within your control because even though like you said you can't control well all of those have some components that you can you can control and i think that can be an important segue for us to think about um the work that we can do moving forward so let me see how much time we have real quick okay we're still good on time so let's think about this for a second so right now we know that um the the anxiety for you comes up when the situations where you feel like there's a loss of control or work there's something that you can't control and then we've been able to identify three situations that have happened to you just within the week where you notice that the anxiety came up because of that control reason so one of the things that i think can be important for us to do is you being able to think bigger about what it means to be in control of the things in your life so for the things that you just mentioned no you might not be able to control um when you can schedule for the class or the fact that you can't schedule on a saturday or on the weekend but if we think about those different scenarios what i want you to start thinking about is what within those situations is within your scope of control so with each of those situations we know that there's things that are outside of your control that you can't do anything about but equally within those situations there are some things that you can control so instead of worrying about those things that you can't control what i want us to think about is what it would look like for you to focus more on those things that are within your control okay so let's take the first example um with you scheduling for the class we knew you couldn't schedule on the weekend but what is something if you were to look at it maybe from a different perspective you could feasibly say this is something that i could do right now where i am with what i have so if you were to ask yourself those questions what do you think you will come up with in that first scenario",
    "answer": "yeah because the class scheduling my classes out of my control uh the virus is like you can only do so much with that because you do still have to live life and it's just that possibility when you leave your room or even sharing it with your sleep make sure your roommates there's still that possibility because they're going out or um their parents are helping them move in or whatever the case may be people are in and out of the building so i still think it stems from that not being able to control it that worry that you can't like disinfect your roommate yourself orthings like that"
  },
  {
    "question": "good okay so that's a perfect example and i think this could be a good um note for you to make in your journal or your notebook or even on your move chart is asking yourself those questions is what can i do right now where i am with what i have and then having that be a pattern of thinking that you integrate in when that worry comes now again that's another thing it's not going to work all the time none of these tools are going to work all the time but it just helps to give you another tool in your toolbox when the anxiety starts to come and feels like it's getting really heavy okay okay so for the other situations do you think that using that um what can i do right now where i am with what i have do you think that could have been helpful in those other situations the other two that we talked about",
    "answer": "so with that one the first thing that i did was i called my aunt and she was saying well there's nothing you can do right now but email the teacher that whose class you're trying to get into but then i emailed my new professor and then she was saying it's okay you can wait until monday so that's kind of like how i fixed that just emailing that professor the new professor and emailing the old professor and then saying um what can i do and they were just saying it's okay wait until monday i'll sign a paper for you don't worry about it yeah i did that"
  },
  {
    "question": "exactly yeah and that that's about all it can be sometimes and and you being more comfortable knowing that um there are going to be some elements of things that you can't control but that doesn't mean that there aren't certain things that you can do to protect yourself so even if you use that same three levels of thinking with other as it relates to covid um you can still think about what can i do where i am right now with what i have right now you know you can use your hand sanitizer you can make sure you have your mask you can make sure you do the social distancing those are the things that are within your control everything else that you can't control then those are the things that we have to worry about or we have to figure out how we can begin minimizing some of your worry around those things that are outside of your control so um was it anything else this week outside of those three things that you think stuck out based off of what we talked about so far",
    "answer": "um to an extent okay i think for like the college experience um like going to the bingo thing that one was kind of like a risk i was taking to like have fun so i think in my mind i would have to think of um ways of like protecting myself so like what i would have would be hand sanitizer and a mask that's probably about it"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay so let's think about um moving forward for the week so one of the things that i want us to delve a little bit more deeply into when i talked before about us deconstructing um the negative thinking that you're having um around this idea of i can't control it so sometimes that can lead to a deeper level of thought so i want to take some time to explore that a little bit and i want you to think back to what is kind of like the earliest memory that you have of having that feeling or thought of i need to be in control or i have to control this",
    "answer": "not really no"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay so that's important because you it's important for you to know that these ideas and beliefs and thoughts that you have they didn't just come from nowhere they oftentimes stem from a much earlier belief that was reinforced over time and then throughout you living your life there probably been things in your life that's reinforced this idea and thought that i have to be in control and i'm sure that there might be a lot of other areas in your life where that has come into play so this is um a pattern of behavior you feeling like you need to be in control it's more of a protection thing from what i'm hearing you say is um you you maybe want to protect yourself from feeling like things are going to get um to get in a position to where you can't figure out what the end goal is going to be or you won't have control over the outcome or it'll be something that you can't recover from so it maybe it's this idea that i have to make sure that i know what's coming ahead so i can prepare for it before something bad happens or before the bottom falls out",
    "answer": "maybe like living with my mom and then things with school so like if education wasn't important to her i knew it was something that was important to me so i want to go to college so if she was saying oh you don't have to go to school today i figured that i needed to put myself in a position to where school is important and i need to go to school and i need to make sure i have this and this stuff it'll probably be that"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah so then if that's the case that can absolutely create a lot of anxiety because one of the questions that i think we need to ask is what would it look like if you were able to relinquish some of that control so if you were i know it's kind of like a big deal even just the thought of it can sometimes create a lot of anxiety what do you think your life would look like or could look like if you made the decision to not think about the end goal or the outcome but just to kind of let things go with the flow how do you think your life would be",
    "answer": "yeah I agree"
  },
  {
    "question": "that's good and you know that's one of the telltale signs when you notice that um anxiety is present because i often tell people anxiety is one of those emotions that keeps you thinking too far back into the past or too far ahead into the future and it robs you of being present because you're always thinking about things that you didn't do or things you could have done or things that you wish you that you did differently or you're always projecting forward thinking about what's about to happen or is this going to work out or what if this doesn't happen then i have to do that so you're either too far back in the past too far ahead in the future and then you can't enjoy the things that are happening for you right now so with you thinking about what would it look like for you to just be present in the moment that's not saying that you can't plan i think that's important for us to to note that that planning is absolutely a part of what it would take for you to reach your goals because that's what you're doing now being in college you have a goal that you're trying to reach because your goal is to be a doctor right",
    "answer": "um i think my first thought is i would be like a wreck i like to plan like i use my planner for everything and i feel like if it doesn't fit within the planner or meet the standards to go in the planner it's not going to work so i feel like if i was to like just throw the planner away i think without thinking about like the bad that could happen i think things will go smoothly okay i think if i would not worry about like the things i can't control or if i didn't worry about the stuff that i don't even know about yet like this i worry about the future stuff if i like stayed in the present i think i would be better or it would be easier to live if i didn't have those worries"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay so we know that you have that end goal in mind but the purpose of it is not to not plan but the focus of what we're talking about is more so about being in alignment with those things that as you're planning that again are within your area of",
    "answer": "yeah"
  },
  {
    "question": "mm hmm",
    "answer": "influence that are within your scope of focus things that um you have control over versus the things that you don't and when i get people thinking about well what's the difference between what i can control and what i can't you have to know that the things that you can control are your thoughts your feelings your emotions your reactions the things that you can't control are other people's thoughts feelings behaviors and reactions so whenever you notice yourself thinking about oh did they use their hand sanitizer or did they wash their hands or the professor didn't email me back all of those things are outside of your your control and the things that are within your control are the things that have to do with you what you do how you think and how you feel so that's a good way to try to to balance and remember the difference between those two okay"
  },
  {
    "question": "i can relate it to the class things we talked about earlier like how i couldn't register for the class so i think what that would look like is kind of like going back to the doing what i have control over so that would be instead of trying to plan all the way like you're not going to be able to get out of this class i can look at what can you do now so that's waiting until monday or just kind of focusing on i don't know that's where it gets gray",
    "answer": "okay so um what i think we can do now is um thinking more about the areas that are outside of your control and that issue of needing to control so i still want us to go a little bit more into what would that look like if you were to relinquish that control so right now you said it would feel chaotic like you couldn't plan um but let's say for example if you still could plan what do you think that would look like so it's not totally chaotic you still have a planner so how do you think that would look"
  },
  {
    "question": "i think because i am a planner i try to think so far into the future but i think that's the part that i struggle with as far as like managing the anxiety part",
    "answer": "how so"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah okay i think no matter what i do i think that's always in the back of my head so like i can probably say i've probably thought about what if i can't get into this class on monday like 12 times like the whole entire day so i feel like that's probably my biggest issue",
    "answer": "yeah well i think the part of it is not so much the planning for for you i don't i don't know that that's what the issue is i think what i'm hearing from you is the issue is what if it doesn't work out it's always that the negative tone to it it's not like oh i'm planning knowing that i'm going to make it to my goals it's like what if i don't or what if you know what if i don't get into the class it's always this element of fear that i'm hearing that comes up where maybe that's leading your plan so what do you think about that does that sound like it could possibly be true that maybe it's not the planning that is the issue but maybe it's the fear of not reaching your goals or the fear of what if it doesn't happen that really creates the anxiety"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah",
    "answer": "right it's always worst case scenario"
  },
  {
    "question": "you're gonna get into this class on monday it's going to be fine don't worry about that",
    "answer": "okay so then that can go back to that imaginative kind of visionary uh thinking that we were talking about before is what would it look like if you didn't think worst case scenario what kind of things would you say to yourself"
  },
  {
    "question": "i would and i think that's why i think about the negative so much because it's like if i'm already prepared for the negative i can't be disappointed because i already knew that this wasn't going to happen or even i'll still be upset but like in my head i'll be like you know that mckay was you knew it wasn't going to happen yeah so you like to prepare for the worst so you don't have to deal with the disappointment",
    "answer": "well you could say that but then if that didn't happen you would be disappointed"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay so i think that's important an important thought i want us to put a pin in that because we can go um a lot deeper than what we have time to to today but let's write that down not wanting to deal with the disappointment and then when we have more time to get a little bit deeper into that we can explore a little bit what that might stem from and how we can get to the root cause of that feeling discipline feeling feeling disappointed um but i think with that with the worst case scenario thinking um one of the things that i always wonder or like to get people thinking about is if you can think worst case scenario what would it look like for you um to create a scenario where things actually did work out for you if you practice on saying those things to yourself do you think if you did that it would be too um unrealistic",
    "answer": "pretty much"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay yeah and it can feel like that",
    "answer": "sometimes"
  },
  {
    "question": "exactly yeah so then i think what we need to begin thinking about is how we how we can have a balance of that because it sounds like you want to be realistic from what i'm hearing you say you want to be realistic around the fact that disappointment is going to come so you don't want to set your your stakes up or your standards up too high because you know things might not work out um but then you still have some elements where you're planning so it can so you're kind you're doing both but it sounds like the fear is what's what's driving you the most is that fear of failure or feel of fear of losing control so what i want us to think about doing is how can we integrate a more realistic um idea of of what can happen in your life as opposed to it going to the default of the worst case scenario or that bad thing that can happen so let's say for example if you didn't think oh i'm going to ace this test or i know i'm going to get um a i'm not going to i'm going to do a good job on it and i know that i'ma pass this class because that might not be realistic so one of the things that i think could be helpful for us to think about doing is not maybe doing those the big extravagant um i know this is going to work out perfectly but maybe just some affirmations and some some proof that you can give to yourself to reaffirm what you already know so for example you might not know that you're going to pass the class but what you do know is that you spent five hours studying or what you do notice that you went to two study tables last week so we have to look for some evidence of things that we know that you did that can affirm that belief so it's not kind of like pie in the sky unrealistic but we have proof of actions that you've done to reaffirm those ideas so let's say for example if we were to use um you passing the class what do you think could be some realistic ideas that we could say or you could say to yourself not saying i'm gonna get an a i know i'm gonna pass but something that you think you could give yourself evidence based off some actions that you've taken",
    "answer": "yeah especially being in college i think that's sometimes unrealistic because there's a lot of times i've walked before the test like i'm gonna do great i gotta date and then my grades is not so good"
  },
  {
    "question": "good",
    "answer": "um i asked questions when i was confused"
  },
  {
    "question": "good",
    "answer": "um i studied and read my chapters when i needed to i completed all my assignments on time"
  },
  {
    "question": "see that's a more realistic idea to tell yourself not that i'm gonna pass the class but i did the best i could i set aside time to make sure that i understood the information as best as i knew how so with that i think that would be more realistic if you told yourself those things reinforce the evidence of the things that you've done as opposed to um creating an expectation around um something that you want to happen that maybe you've not even done the work for or the proof isn't there does that make sense okay so let's look at the time to see how how we're doing okay we still have a couple more minutes is it anything else any thoughts or reflections that you have on what we discussed so far",
    "answer": "and i did what i could absolutely"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah yeah i think that's good i think that that goes back to the doing what you can where you are with what you have in those situations i think that could totally be helpful for you and you know be mindful when when that anxiety comes up and try to try to do that process of i'm just going to do what i can where i am with what i have try to get that to be as automatic as the negative thoughts are automatic but it's going to cause you to be really intentional um about your thinking before it starts to spiral down into something more negative because what that can spiral into i always tell people anxiety and depression are distant cousins so what that means is your anxiety can start by oh i gotta get in this class i gotta get registered let me figure out how i can get get in if i don't get in then i'm not gonna pass but i'm not gonna passthen i'm not gonna be able to graduate on time and then it's it just starts going down a slippery slope so once you're in that ruminating negative thinking and your thoughts are going really fast and you're worrying what that can spiral into is is sadness and depression then you start getting down on yourself and saying kayla you never do anything right you always mess stuff up and every time it comes when you're trying to plan something out you always figure out a way to get it wrong how come you just can't do this or how come you just can't plan earlier do more so then once you start spiraling into that negative thinking then that's when the sadness and the depression comes but it didn't start as sadness and depression it started as worry ruminating concern and fear but now it's gone down to something that's you know making you feel sad not wanting to get out of bed and then it's causing you not to be able to show up for your classes or show up for yourself so you want to catch that anxiety before it begins to spiral down into more depressive and negative thinking okay so we talked about a couple things today so let's talk about moving forward for the week um i want us to talk about what that would look like um for you managing the anxiety moving forward so one i think is great that we've kind of identified and pinpointed when it comes up so we know that it's in situations that you feel like you can't control so with that for this week one of the things that i want you to attune to and be um more particular about um being mindful of is things that are within your control and things that are outside of your control do you remember what we said is the difference between the two okay what do we say",
    "answer": "um i think i really want to try the words of affirmation i think that would help with like the daily stuff like the stuff that i can't control i think that will really work with that since it seems like i have a control problem yeah and i think my anxiety comes from control i think i want to try that for sure and maybe when i do my mood tracker whatever is making me anxious that's what i could put down so if it was um not being able to get into the class if i email my professors and i've already been approved to move to the class just get the papers so i can go to the class i think that's what i want to do"
  },
  {
    "question": "absolutely yeah their feelings thoughts things that are outside of your control good so you want to be mindful you want to be able to put those things in those two buckets when something comes up is this within my control or is this outside of my control and then once you identify that you ask yourself that question is this within my control or is this outside of my control then two can be the second thing that we talked about so if this is inside of my control what can i do where i am with what i have what can i do right now with where i am with what i have and then you could go through that process and then start to think about what would that look like for you so the things that are outside of your control i think it's important for us to talk about that too because those things are still going to create worry even though it's outside of your control that's not going to keep you from worrying from it worrying about it so what do you think um could be a solution or something that you think we could work toward for this week that can help with those things that are outside of your control",
    "answer": "so what we said the things that are in my control is my thinking how i react and then what i do and then what's out of my control with other people's thinking how they react and what they do"
  },
  {
    "question": "do a list",
    "answer": "um could i do the list like that to"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay well i think we can think about it some more so i have a couple ideas on what that could look like um we won't have time to go into it today but um i have some strategies that we can use when it comes to dealing with the things that that are outside of your control i'm just mentioning briefly but um we can talk about it later so one of the things is if you can't control it one of the things that we can think about is if you can't control it can you influence it what things can you do to help influence someone else's actions behavioral behaviors and thoughts so we can get more into thinking what that will look like and then if you can't influence it then we can talk about you know what what do you do then so that could be something we can discuss for next session okay so um we have those two things that i think could be helpful for you to work on and then the thing that i put the pen in the pen in for us to work on later is um not wanting to deal with the disappointment and that being a reason why that control can be showing up or why you might be so adamant about making sure everything is so particular in this way um and then maybe what are some of those feelings and thoughts that could be underlying that disappointment um that's driving your behaviors so we can talk about that too when we have a little bit more time",
    "answer": "like what i can't control i'm not sure how that will look"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay so any um thoughts or takeaways before we wrap up is there anything outside of the action plan that you think will be helpful for you this week or what do you think will be most helpful",
    "answer": "okay"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay how so tell me how you will plan on using that this week",
    "answer": "definitely the words of affirmation"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah that's good so those affirmations you reaffirming to yourself okay michaela you've already done this you've already done that you did this you've prepared this way you've taken these notes you've called this person so you you reminding yourself of the things that you've currently done in the present moment to work towards your goals yeah i think that's good so the affirmations anything else that you think will be helpful any other takeaways",
    "answer": "i think i'm i need to do the what i've already done and what i can do i think that's that's going to help instead of me going straight to the negative i think that will help me stay in the present"

  },
  {
    "question": "what if someone runs into me yeah",

    "answer": "mm-hmm and then we're going to put another box is it through the chain of events here uh-huh the event can make you think in ways that stir up feelings of anxiety and so on so if you're thinking like this it makes sense that you'd be feeling pretty nervous inside and you might have some of these physical reactions let's put those in here this is the emotions box mm-hmm and they are much shaky said yeah plus fear yeah if we're going to write that fear on a zero to a hundred scale and so zero is none at all in a hundreds is maximum of anyone could ever get where would you be at this point"

  },
  {
    "question": "get an escape route if you would yeah so usually you would avoid this if we looked at this as a model for many of these situations about driving and feeling um yes the usual behavior would be to try to get out of way to avoid it",
    "answer": "yeah but I really had no choice I mean I think usually I wouldn't go to the pharmacy usually I was called my I would call my husband and say can you pick it up on your way home"

  },
  {
    "question": "okay so in a way it decreases your confidence over time",
    "answer": "well I feel like I don't really have much confidence when it comes to this to being able to do it"
  },
  {
    "question": "I suspect that that not doing it repeatedly gives you this belief about your capacity to do these driving things and what's that believe",
    "answer": "I think so yeah"
  },
  {
    "question": "so it comes right back to this thought I can't do it and you can't do it so you don't do it right so here's this this chain of events events trigger thoughts we call an automatic thoughts and then they influence your emotions these feelings you have and then that influences how you handle the situation okay now let's think together for a moment before we wrap up of how we might proceed to try to give you some help with this so let's take a look at these thoughts do you know anybody else that drives regularly that might think differently than you",
    "answer": "yeah I don't feel like I can do it"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay give me an example",
    "answer": "yeah"
  },
  {
    "question": "so for some reason we don't know exactly why but the key thing here is not looking at why but to help you was actually making change in this but you do have some differences in the way you think about driving that might be something that we could begin to work on in our session we might for example check it out what's the chances of someone slamming into you okay well what's the chances of you being stranded out there on the highway and even if you were stranded is there a way you could cope with that or manage that you can get back home so these are some things that we can to do so I'm going to or we could work on these thoughts okay and then by working on the thoughts we might be able to help you reduce the emotions but there also some things that I might be able to teach you that you could use to reduce this level of distress that you have that would be on to be able to calm yourself down in situations so we'll have some try to build some skills to manage your emotions and then on this behavior side one thing that we might begin to work on is helping you gradually begin to take on some of these driving things so that you can build your confidence back up and again build your skills to do it and I can see that that process a little bit of edginess here what would you think of when I mentioned that",
    "answer": "I mean I think almost everybody I think most people drive without too much problem but like my sister loves to drive yeah I mean she just she drives every opportunity she gets"
  },
  {
    "question": "well I'm glad you gave me that feedback that's an example by the way of we want to hear from you about the way you're responding to what I'm saying I certainly wouldn't recommend you make it worse okay where to cause you too much anxiety uh-huh and what we'll try to do is pace it a trip to the level that's right for you okay so that you can make some progress and get to the place you want to be which is to be able to drive to your new office cross that big bridge mm-hm and maybe even like those couple hours to visit mission on all right yeah so what do you think",

    "answer": "and it's all been swirling around in your head"
  },
  {
    "question": "I haven't said much I was really scared to tell them actually because I knew they'd just be so disappointed and just embarrassed by the fact that I did fail yeah I've never failed anything before and so yeah it's really hard",
    "answer": "and had they said much to you about failing in the exam"
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "question": "um I think number two",
    "answer": "right okay well I'm glad you've come to counseling because it's good for us to get an outsider's opinion when we've got so much on our plate and we're confused as to what to do and our emotions can get in the way and you've just said earlier that a whole lot of stuff's on your plate at the moment okay so I'm glad you've come here here at the clinic we use the ABC model which is a cognitive behavioral therapy model hold on so Marsha some counselors have put together a list of beliefs that we often use we don't realize that we're using those beliefs and they tend to be faulty ones here's the list here have a look through that to see if there are any beliefs that you might be operating on at the moment"

    "question": "but it's necessary to have a higher degree of order and certainty in order to be happy and perform well",
    "answer": "okay um read that one out for me"

  {
    "question": "that I need to be successful all the time in everything that I do",
    "answer": "okay yeah how would you put that in your own words"
  },
  {
    "question": "ah well failing that exam I mean I wasn't successful with that so yeah it just dries out I guess even number two cuz throw that all the order in my life I I need to have everything you know that I need to know what I'm doing where I'm going yes",
    "answer": "yeah and is that different from what's happening in your life at the moment"
  },
  {
    "question": "I don't feel like I'm good enough",
    "answer": "okay so if number four is an expectation that your family having that you have of yourself how do you measure up next to number four"
  },
  {
    "question": "um I mean there are a lot of things but I think obviously failing the exam was the main one",
    "answer": "okay alright well what I'd like to do is is put some of those ideas on the board under the ABC and I'll explain as we go along okay okay so what do you think the trigger point might be or the activating event for you at the moment"

  {
    "question": "me thinking of leaving uni",
    "answer": "okay alright and and the consequence is"
  },
  {
    "question": "I failed my exam",

  },
  {
    "question": "I'm not good enough",
    "answer": "that's right and the kind of decision that you're thinking about is leaving uni that's right okay so it's important that we consider the jump from here over to here and the kind of thinking that you've been swirling around in your head affects the consequence and you've mentioned earlier that number four seems to fit and you put that in your own words what were your words before that"
  },
  {
    "question": "I'm working it it's a really demanding job you know keeping up with it I guess work um things with my fiancee I mean we're engaged so planning the wedding that's going really well it's stressful but it's going well",
    "answer": "yeah it's really important for us to consider that kind of thinking okay Marsha it's good that we've got those things on the board and what I'd like to do now is focus stepping out of it from your situation and looking looking at it from another point of view to me it sounds like if you're doing a whole lot of things really well can you list all of the things that you're doing really well"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah never failed anything before this is the first one so I guess all the other subjects",

  },
  {
    "question": "yeah",
    "answer": "so would you describe yourself as successful most of the time yeah most of the time"
  },

    "answer": "and what's the evidence for that"
  },
  {
    "question": "I guess in comparison I am good enough",
    "answer": "that's right yeah so how do all of those successes compare to that belief that you've written that I've written on the board for you"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah",
    "answer": "yeah that's right yeah and all the evidence is there all of the subjects that you've passed in first year and now second year you have a full-time job that's a success its great"
  },
  {
    "question": "all right",
    "answer": "okay well what I'd like to do is get you to write that on the board"
  },

  {
    "question": "I can try again everything doesn't have to be 100% all the time huh I mean I could reset the exam",
    "answer": "why is that"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah I mean I am good enough compared to all the things that you helped me realize with all the successes that I've had that's wrong I am good enough",
    "answer": "okay yeah yeah and we've talked about all your successes yeah so it's harder now to believe that top statement that I'm not good enough"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah I will stay I mean I am good enough so I'm sure I can give it another go and see how I go from there I can reset the exam and I'm sure I'll be fine",
    "answer": "yeah good okay and so this idea about staying at uni tell me about that"
  },
  {
    "question": "thank you",
    "answer": "okay good okay what I'd like you to do is to keep saying that statement I am good enough say it in front of the mirror two or three times a day so that you've build up your confidence because it's going to take some time to reprogram your computer up here with that kind of positive belief about yourself rather than carrying around another belief and we tend to carry those other beliefs for years and years and years and so it's going to take a bit of work on your part to deliberately change your thinking and change your belief system but you've made a great start here today so congratulations"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah it really makes me feel really anxious like what I look like and what people are thinking",
    "answer": "you said that when you're in work you worry a lot about how you come across in social situations"

    "answer": "yeah you said that you worried that you and visibly shake and are there any other things that you worry that people will notice"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah definately",
    "answer": "so it sounds like you have quite a strong mental image of how you see yourself when you're in these social situations"
  },
  {
    "question": "just like I think I just look really obviously weird and out of place and like really red and just visibly shaking and sweating and kind of not being able to communicate properly with people",
    "answer": "so you go red you shake so anything else that you think that you do I mean describe yourself how do you think you look when you're in these situations"
  },
  {
    "question": "um I guess like when I'm holding the camera I just grip onto it really really tight and or I kind of clench all my muscles and just find something that I can focus on and to kind of try and make myself shake less and not it was red and stuff mm-hmm",
    "answer": "and is there anything that you do to try and kind of defend against these things to manage and these problems"
  },
  {
    "question": "no I just tend to just look down",
    "answer": "so you focus on something you grip onto the camera do you make eye contact with people"
  },

    "question": "I just as I said of looking down and like wearing all black so it's less obvious and kind of worrying yeah just more layers and all blacks is you just can't tell",
    "answer": "okay so you also avoid eye contact isthere anything else that you do to manage the sweating for example"
  },
  {
    "question": "I think it would be so much worse so yeah I think I just would just shake even more and be more anxious and look up more obviously kind of weird and out of place",
    "answer": "mm-hmm okay what'd you think would happen if you stopped doing these things if you stopped gripping onto the camera or you know you started making eye contact and not looking down and what do you think would happen"
  },
  {
    "question": "um I just kind of all just like fumble and like kind of just clenched whatever whatever it is I'm holding just really tight and just make sure I don't make any eye contact at all just kind of get through it",
    "answer": "mm-hmm what I'm thinking now is how would you feel about if we did an experiment to to test out your thoughts on what would happen if you stopped doing these things if we did a bit of a roleplay where we pretended to enact a situation at work and if we did this maybe twice and the first time you do all the things that you normally do okay and grip onto something look down and is there anything else that you do when you're in these situations these were conversations to try and cope"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay I will try my best",
    "answer": "okay so in the first time I want you to do those things as much as you normally would in fact maybe even slightly more than you normally would and then the second time I want you to drop doing those things all together okay does that sound"

    "answer": "yeah we'll use that in just a sec before we do this then we're just going to fill out this form it's sir because what we're doing now is an experiment we call it a behavioral experiment to see what happens when you change the way that you're behaving okay so the first column says I need to fill out an experiment test this thought that you have so that our experiment is going to be that we do a conversation at work and who should I play if you're playing yourself in this role play who should I be"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah",
    "answer": "okay so would it work if I was maybe having a wedding and I was hiring a wedding photographer"

  {
    "question": "like 90",
    "answer": "okay so visibly shaking so how how much will you be shaking if a hundred is like shaking uncontrollably and zero is not shaking at all how physically shaking will you be"
  },
  {
    "question": "um okay so I'm gonna go red",
    "answer": "okay and but sorry what was the other thing that you just said"

    "answer": "mm-hmm you also said that you thought it was going to be twice as bad when you stopped using your normal strategies yeah what did you notice watching that video"
  },
  {
    "question": "I recently broke up with a long long-term partner and it's been one of many breakups I've had in my life and at this point I'm getting older I have gray hair I feel like the clock is ticking and I don't feel like I will ever find somebody who loves me I don't feel like I feel like I would have found them already I feel like I've dated enough people to make that happen and it's not happening and I don't see anything changing and my depression is through the roof because of it",
    "answer": "Kyle what brings you in today"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah",
    "answer": "okay so I'm sorry about your breakup and I'm sorry that I kind of led to a cascade of thoughts in your head about what this really means about your future for relationships and about you ultimately so we're gonna do a practice technique right now and this technique is called loitering and what this is gonna help us with is getting some of those negative automatic thoughts I mean you said many right now actually just in your description we're gonna work with one of those and it helps us to get them organized in a way so that you can actually see what that automatic thought leads to sort of like if you think about automatic thoughts being kind of like an iceberg and the automatic thoughts is the tip of the iceberg that you can see above the water it's conscious but you have to kind of attune your awareness to it but deeper thoughts are actually submerged you can't see them they're below the water level and that's what we need to get to because that's the crux of the issue these core beliefs drive how you feel how you think and even the rules that you have in life about how you should behave in order to have safety in many ways and so let's start with an automatic thought I heard you say that you were thinking based on this breakup and other ones that I might never find somebody who will love me"
  },
  {
    "question": "well I look around at my friends and my family who are in relationships who are having kids who are posting pictures who are sending out Christmas cards with their significant others and I don't feel like I will have that I feel like while everyone else we'll have love in their life mm-hmm and meaning and purpose mm-hmm I will have nothing I will be alone and I am alone and I am also lonely mm-hmm and that is devastating",
    "answer": "so let's work with that automatic thought there were other ones I think this one is a good one to work with so if your automatic thought is I'm not gonna find somebody who loves me what might that mean like what does that thought mean to you"
  },
  {
    "question": "well on one hand it means that nobody I on one hand it means that people wouldn't if I'm alone it means that people don't want to be with me which is awful",
    "answer": "so what might it mean if you were alone like let's take that part of it so you know you kind of broke it down like well I don't think that I'm gonna find anybody to love me or who all of or who will have this relationship with and and to me that means that I'll be alone so what would it mean if you were alone like what if that did happen what would that mean about you"
  },
  {
    "question": "and it also means that I won't be able to enjoy life how I could mm-hm I will miss out on dinners and holidays and weekend trips and children and legacy and memories mm-hmm there are there's a laundry list of consequences from being alone",
    "answer": "it's an awful thought"
  },
  {
    "question": "that there's something wrong with me",
    "answer": "right and you had just said that one of the things that being alone means would be that maybe that means nobody wants to be with you and so what would that thought mean if it was true what if nobody wanted to be with you what if that was an actual fact like what would that mean"
  },
  {
    "question": "that I haven't done a good job in my life becoming I haven't done a good job becoming somebody that people want to be around that people want to be in a relationship with",
    "answer": "mm-hmm and if there is something wrong with you if that thought was true then what would that mean"
  },
  {
    "question": "that I'm oh that I'm worthless and I'm a waste of time",
    "answer": "right and what would that mean about you if people didn't want to be in a relationship with you that you haven't done a good job and people didn't want to be around you"
  },
  {
    "question": "I don't feel if you would have asked me three minutes ago or four minutes ago do do you think or do you think you're a worthless person I would have said no mm-hmm not at all",
    "answer": "yeah well that's the core belief the core belief is I'm worthless or sometimes people will say I'm unlovable sometimes they're interchangeable but like that's how we got to the core belief is we keep doing this latter in technique where any negative thought you have I ask you what does that mean if that thought was true what would that mean about you okay well if that thought was true that would mean that I would be alone okay well what would that mean if that was true if you were alone well that would mean that nobody would want to be around me you know and you kind of kept breaking it down to like the deeper and deeper level until you got to this idea of that would mean that I was worthless that maybe I'm just not capable of being loved that I'm undeserving of love and that's what we mean by a core belief which is like a horrible thing to have to think about and I want to be clear that core beliefs are not necessarily what you actually believe about yourself the core beliefs are your biggest fear meaning that if it was true it would be devastating if you truly were worthless or if you truly were unlovable that would be devastating"
  },
  {
    "question": "well I would I would probably only in terms of a romantic relationship I would probably only date someone who I felt was like below my league I guess yeah that's a rude thing to say",
    "answer": "right yeah and I think that when people first encounter what could be their horse core belief they they have that kind of reaction of but I don't really believe it's true at least not until actually but it's really about the fear of man but what if it was true like what would that mean about my life and what I could even amount to and what kind of legacy would I leave behind if that was true and everybody has different fears for different reasons some people's core belief is you know I'm incapable you know and that to them is paralyzing like me man if I wasn't capable like that could ruin my life you know and it's not that they actually believe they're incapable it's but it's just like oh my gosh if that was true the consequences to my life would be devastating and I wouldn't even be able to tolerate it and so this is sort of what we're working with and I always say when we get to a core belief doesn't necessarily have to be your core belief but let's let's work with it let's see if it is you know part of the - sort of like hypothesis testing like let's work with that and see if that could be true for you okay when people have core beliefs they usually then have conditional rules and assumptions about how the world will work and how they should act within that world mm-hmm so what I mean by this is when you have such a core belief like I'm worthless or I'm unlovable there will be certain things that you believe are scripts that you have to follow in order to have any semblance of emotional safety or to prevent yourself from having that core belief come true and so we're gonna talk about what some of those things could be for you when somebody has a worthless core belief what might that do in terms of your expression of your needs and wants to other people like what rule might you have if you actually believed that you might be worthless or that you fear that that might be true what kind of rule would you put on yourself in terms of how you could communicate your needs and wants to others"
  },
  {
    "question": "because if I if I would truly was worthless then I would need to be with somebody else who couldn't see that who would never know that I was worthless right so I would need to date accordingly right I wouldn't go after the people that I actually wanted to date because they're too smart to figure it out right that's at least",
    "answer": "no I think it's honest and I think you're not alone in that"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah and and I would also try to show my worth a lot hmm even though I believed I'm worthless I would try to show well look at the great house I have and look at how happy I'm being and look how fun my friends are and look at my cool job and look at look at look at look at see I'm not worthless I'm not working I'm not worthless",
    "answer": "that would be like impossible thinking there"
  },
  {
    "question": "yes I'm always for up for as long as I can remember constantly making sure that the other person was happy with our interaction first mm-hmm professionally friendship romantic familial are you happy with our internet constantly I constantly remember thinking are you happy about this because I want to make sure you're happy about this because I don't want you to have an interaction with me where you're not happy",
    "answer": "right yeah no those are excellent examples of the types of rules you might have when that is your core belief and might you also have a type of rule where you felt like in certain situations you had to contribute something so that there would be worth so like even in friendships for example like how are you like always about them as opposed to oh now we can talk about me for 20 minutes right do you find yourself sometimes doing those other friends"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah I love that part",
    "answer": "right right okay so again another great example of a possible assumption or rule that you might put on yourself when this is the core belief and so as you might imagine there's a long list of these if we sat here for two hours would probably come up with my 20 other rules that probably play some role in your life but I want to move on to the problem-solving phase you know because that's what CBT is all about is like let's solve the problem so"
  },
  {
    "question": "mm-hmm well I have a friend",
    "answer": "so we have identify the issue and there's many very many different ways in which you can work with your core beliefs but you have to remember that these core beliefs have been there for a long time and they're kind of pervasive like this idea of I'm worthless as you just demonstrated it's not just about your romantic relationships is about how you interact with friends with professional people with colleagues whatever there there's permeating of sorts in almost all the domains of your life and so what we're gonna do now is one of my favorite ways to work with core beliefs and assumptions once we've identified them and that is to create an individualized behavioral experiment okay to try to see if your core beliefs and the assumptions that follow them actually apply to every single situation as I mentioned core beliefs feel pervasive and we want to make them more can you know we want to make it so that well you know in certain situations and with certain people they may make me feel this way and maybe that even come from childhood but it doesn't apply to every single thing right and the way that we shake that is to actually get evidence CBT is a scientific program and this is kind of like our mini science experiment that we're gonna do together so there's only a couple of rules for this experiment we're going to design an experiment around one of your rules or assumptions and the one that I want to use which i think is a good one to do because you want to start with a lower hanging fruit that's not too activating like we shouldn't start with the rule of you dating people who might be of a different level than you because that one is a little bit deeper but we start with something that feels like you can approach it and there's a little bit of risk it makes you a little uncomfortable but not like the worst thing that could happen and I think that that would apply to the rule of I always have to take care of other people's needs first because there's a lot of people that applies to it can apply to your intimate relationships but it can also apply to friends colleagues anybody else that you meet so let's take that rule and let's try to test it with a person in your life and I would also say that again this person should not be the most activating person but there should be a person who there's some stakes in it there's some skin in the game but this is not a person in which if this experiment failed meaning that like you tried to challenge this assumption and they failed it in some way and actually major core belief île more significant to you that you would feel bad about it but you wouldn't be so bad that you would be in pieces so is there a person like that who you're like huh like I've always taken care of this person's needs first like as I usually do and I could probably test something out with them and if it didn't work out I'd be kind of sad about it but like I wouldn't be devastated"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay great okay and so this is somebody that how long have you known this friend",
    "answer": "and mine"
  },
  {
    "question": "oh wow okay so 10 years",
    "answer": "10 10 more than 10 years"
  },
  {
    "question": "right yeah but you guys have been familiar like most of the times you're probably taking care of this friend",
    "answer": "yeah but we're not like every day friends"
  },
  {
    "question": "how are you like oh let me give you advice like what can I bring you you're sick like that kind of relationship all right so this experiment it's gonna be very time limited it's gonna be very specific so I need you to set like a specific date and time that you gonna do this in the next seven days",
    "answer": "right"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah I would say to be real specific because we need to get that data and it's gonna be something that's kind of contained meaning it should be something where it's not like a free-for-all like from now on I'm just gonna be you know weird vomit and always tell about my problems first but it's more about okay in this particular conversation I'm going to go with him with the problem and once I talk about the problem get his advice I'm gonna be like that was so helpful thank you goodbye and not make that about him at all because that's the other thing where with your type of poor belief and assumptions sometimes you'll be like and how are you and then you spend another 45 minutes",
    "answer": "okay"
  },
  {
    "question": "so we're not gonna do that this is literally gonna be you going to him to express a need of yours to express a problem have this person give you the advice and then be like thank you that was super helpful talk to you later so that's the experiment",
    "answer": "absolutely"
  },
  {
    "question": "yes you have to go do that",
    "answer": "and I have to go do that"
  },
  {
    "question": "so first we're gonna predict how you think that's gonna go so based on your beliefs or maybe your assumptions and rules like how do you think that might go like in terms of maybe how you might feel or what they might feel or do",
    "answer": "and then what are you expecting me to report back with"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay do you think that he's gonna have some kind of inner judgement of you like Kyle's selfish you didn't even ask about me today",
    "answer": "well I mean I think it will go fine"
  },
  {
    "question": "yeah well let's get specific and that do you think that that's a possibility",
    "answer": "mmm I mean maybe I don't know"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay yes you obviously don't want that to be anybody's thoughts about you",
    "answer": "yes"
  },
  {
    "question": "all right so you're gonna hold you're gonna hold that to stress a little bit for yourself and then you said it's gonna probably go find meaning like you think you can carry it through but it might make you a little uncomfortable",
    "answer": "no"
  },
  {
    "question": "and start being like it how are you",
    "answer": "yeah and I'm hoping I don't slip up"
  },
  {
    "question": "and it just completely turns around yeah yeah exactly okay so we've laid out a couple of expectations one is well I'm sure he'll be fine with giving me the advice but maybe in his mind hope you like whoa cost being selfish today like didn't even ask how I am and also you might just feel kind of like icky and then you're afraid that you might like break and just start to like take care of him so you feel better about yourself",
    "answer": "uh-huh and go oh well I'm sorry that you went through something you know like"
  },
  {
    "question": "so those are the expectations all right so then you're gonna do this experiment so when do you think you can do something like this to give me a day",
    "answer": "exactly"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay tomorrow and then what problem do you think you're gonna bring him",
    "answer": "tomorrow"
  },
  {
    "question": "so you'll just talk about that and oh my gosh I need help with this",
    "answer": "I'll bring him a just I'm just so stressed out I'm so busy okay which is true okay"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay great that's perfect and then we'll kind of keep a time-limited so how long do you think the conversation will be just give me",
    "answer": "yeah like it's it's on a level that I've never experienced before"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay and remember we're not gonna think in another 20 minutes to make it about them",
    "answer": "15 minutes perfect"
  },
  {
    "question": "awesome so then we're gonna do this and we've already talked about the expectations and after you do it I want to I want you to do two things one is I want you to actually ask him at the end of that conversation was this okay with you that today we just talked about me I'm just really stressed you literally asked him that very specific question because you want to get some level feedback of course he can still lie to you right it at least gives you some semblance of what he might be thinking and I don't think he's expecting that kind of question from you",
    "answer": "yeah okay"
  },
  {
    "question": "so you would be like hey I got a run because I'm busy but just so just so I know like was this okay that I called you just to get your advice today and we didn't get to talk about how you're doing",
    "answer": "no"
  },
  {
    "question": "okay cool",
    "answer": "I can do that"
  },
  {
    "question": "awesome so then he'll give you some feedback about that you will write that down and you will write down just your feelings leading up to it like was it that discomforting and then once you get that feedback from him how did you feel then and I will say that what I'm expecting is this guy's been your friend for 10 years that he's probably gonna be like dude it's cool like that's what friends are for something like that and then using that experience we're gonna now go back to your assumptions again and say did that assumption really hold I mean do you always have to take care of people or are there at least certain people in your life who you can have a back and forth with and this is the first step then we do another experiment with a different person and a different kind of experiment so that we can loosen these assumptions make them more conditional and that will feed back to that core belief like is it truly as universal as you think it is and that's really it's gonna be the process so it'll take a few weeks for us to execute it all the way through but this is the first step and I think if you can do this first step it's going to start to shake that assumption enough for the rest of our work",
    "answer": "I can totally do that"
  },
  {
    "question": "cool right",
    "answer": "Wow"
  },
  {
    "question": "its gonna be fun",
    "answer": "it's really good"
  },
  {
    "question": "So hi Julie, how are you doing today?",
    "answer": "I hope so"
  },
  {
    "question": "No, well I'm sorry to hear that. I understand you're meeting with other members of our team?",
    "answer": "Not great."
  },
  {
    "question": "Uh huh.",
    "answer": "Yeah, yeah I saw the dietician, she gave me like a new meal plan and stuff."
  },
  {
    "question": "Great, so… and when we met, we talked a little bit about confidentiality and do you have any questions about that?",
    "answer": "And the nurse practitioner."
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah so everything we talk about here is confidential so it's important that you feel safe, feel comfortable, because when people come talk to me they often have some sensitive issues they need to talk about. And you're okay to go ahead with meeting with me, with working with me?",
    "answer": "No, I remember."
  },
  {
    "question": "Okay, great. Can you tell me a little bit about how you're doing and what brings you in?",
    "answer": "Yeah, that's fine."
  },
  {
    "question": "Mm-hmm yeah, so you find yourself in a place where things aren’t going as you had planned that they would and a sense of feeling like you're to blame.",
    "answer": "I'm just feeling pretty bad, yeah I just feel like you know how you have plans that you set for yourself and you think, oh by 30 this will happen and I feel like it was going in the right direction and then everything just got messed up and it's mostly my fault so..."
  },
  {
    "question": "It's your fault, yeah.",
    "answer": "Yes."
  },
  {
    "question": "It's pretty stupid. I live with my mom now so… and I'm on disability so I don't have a job. So I basically like, watch TV in her basement. Have fights with her and that's about all.",
    "answer": "Yeah, and can you tell me a little bit how your life looks like, what does it look like day to day?"
  },
  {
    "question": "Not now, I used to have friends but the thing is now I just feel like I'm kind of a burden to them more than a friend so I just don't really reach out to them.",
    "answer": "Yeah. And do you have friends?"
  },
  {
    "question": "Well... she…",
    "answer": "Mm-hmm… well can you say a little bit more about your relationship is like with your mother?"
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah, I mean it's probably annoying for her that I'm living there. But she is still kind of treating me like a child, like always asking, you know, what I'm eating and what my insulin levels are and, you know…",
    "answer": "And how you interact with her?"
  },
  {
    "question": "I don't think so.",
    "answer": "Yeah, that's sounds really like you're in a really difficult situation right now. Things sound really, really hard for you. Yeah, so the reason that you were referred to meet with me is for counseling around your mood and it sounds like things are really, really difficult for you. And the kind of approach to therapy that I provide is a form of counseling called cognitive behavioural therapy. Have you hear of that before?"
  },
  {
    "question": "Okay.",
    "answer": "No, okay so cognitive behavioural therapy is a form of psychotherapy and it was developed in the 1960's by a psychiatrist by the name of Dr. Aaron Beck and one of the reasons it's become very, very popular is because there's a lot of research to support that it's really effective, it really does help people improve their mood and it teaches them skills to manage their mood on their own. So, you know we would meet once a week for an hour for a certain number of sessions and there are 168 hours during the week so I would ask that you would practice what we learn, these skills for managing your mood, outside of the sessions. So the more that people are able to practice the skills outside of the session, the greater the likelihood that there would be success in improving your mood."
  },
  {
    "question": "I can try.",
    "answer": "Does that sound like something that you could do?"
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah.",
    "answer": "To give that a try, to try and do something just a little bit every day to improve your mood."
  },
  {
    "question": "Well I think that she's treating me like a child and that I shouldn't be living with her in the first place.",
    "answer": "Yeah, and one thing I would like to say is that it's really not uncommon for people who are diagnosed with a chronic illness to suffer from mood problems like depression, it's a very difficult adjustment to make when your life goes one way and then all of the sudden it changes very suddenly. So cognitive behavioural therapy is really focused on understanding the connection between our thoughts and our feelings. So we have thoughts that are going around in our minds all the time and they really do impact on how we feel emotionally. So to kind of illustrate how that works, I want to bring up an example that you already... that you already brought up in terms of your relationship with your mother. So you talked about how your mother is sort of on your case and sometimes she'll ask you, you know, have you checked your blood sugar levels. So in that kind of situation, what kind of thoughts would come up in your mind?"
  },
  {
    "question": "And that I can't even take care of myself properly.",
    "answer": "Mm-hmm."
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah.",
    "answer": "Okay. Okay so you feel like you are a child, you're thinking that you're like being treated like a child that shouldn't be living there."
  },
  {
    "question": "Well, I feel angry at my mother.",
    "answer": "Should be on your own, okay, so those are the thoughts that come up. So I'm going to use this as an example to illustrate what we call the five point model. So we start with the thoughts, and then related to our thoughts can be emotion, so when you have these kinds of thoughts in this kind of situation, what kind of emotions would you experience?"
  },
  {
    "question": "And I feel kind of worthless because I am, and I guess I just feel sad a lot.",
    "answer": "Mm-hmm."
  },
  {
    "question": "Yeah.",
    "answer": "Yeah, yeah, so those thoughts trigger those emotions--"
  },
  {
    "question": "and the other one would be a physical response. So what kind of behaviours do you notice that you may kind of start to do or engage in when this sort of situation happens?",
    "answer": "--would you say? Okay. So I'm going to add to this diagram, so there's two more circles that I'm going to add, one of them would be our behaviours,"
  },
  {
    "question": "Okay. So you get angry and you yell and then you’ll sort of withdraw, you'll isolate in the basement?",
    "answer": "Well, usually I'll yell at mother like first thing but then mostly I'll just go back to the basement and watch TV and..."
  },
  {
    "question": "Uh huh. Okay. And what about... do you notice what kind of physical response, what happens in your body, how you feel in your body when this sort of thing happens?",
    "answer": "Yeah."
  },
  {
    "question": "Okay. Alright. Yeah. Okay, so you can notice in any kind of situation it's quite stressful, a lot of things going on with our thoughts, our emotions, our behaviours and our physical response, and then to add to this, adding another layer is the environment. So the environment that we’re in can also influence how we feel, and so the environment may be supportive or may be not supportive and that can influence, influence things. Does this model make sense to you?",
    "answer": "Yeah when she and I are yelling at each other I guess like my muscles are kind of tense and I just feel like my heart beats really fast."
  },
  {
    "question": "Mm-hmm. So throughout the course of our counseling sessions, we'll be sort of trying to understand how these are all interconnected but also how you can start to make some changes, so that ultimately your emotions can start to change, okay?",
    "answer": "Yeah I understand like how those things are all connected."
  },
  {
    "question": "So I mentioned how each week I'm going to be asking you do some homework practice and so my first homework practice assignment for you this week is for you to track your mood. So I have this chart here and so it's divided up between the days of the week and the hours of the day. And so it asks you to track your mood and your level of depression from hour to hour throughout the day. So you would want to rate how intense your emotions are from 0 to 100 so you can see if there's a fluctuation throughout the today, but also to notice if there's anything that you're doing, like note what activities that you're doing, so you can also see if there’s any patterns in terms of like what you do and how you feel. Do you think that you can try that? Yeah, that seems manageable for you to do?",
    "answer": "Okay."
  },
  {
    "question": "Okay, great. Okay, so that's your homework assignment for the week and I think we’ll end there for today. Do you have any questions as we wrap up?",
    "answer": "Yeah."
